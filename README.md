# <p align="center">Learning module on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</p>
<p align="center">A brief course intended for non-Computer Science engineering grads to warm up to data science and getting started</p>

Click [here](https://ai-ml-emod.herokuapp.com/) for accessing the learning module. The module is created using [Articulate 360](https://articulate.com/) and hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).


## 📚 Pre-requisites for taking this course
* Math at high school level. Knowledge of calculus is preferred.
* Exposure to any coding language. 
* Curiosity, patience and a good internet connection.


## 📚 About the project
This course is developed by a trio of mechanical engineering grads working in the 🏭manufacturing and ⚡energy industry for around 10 years.
<br>
We are documenting our journey through the ocean of data science to help us keep track of our journey and one day, hopefully, look back and admire at it.
<br>
Though coding & math are unavoidable, we have tried to make this as non-CS grad-friendly as we possibly can.


## 📚 If you want to use this to chart your own journey in this ever-expanding ocean, welcome aboard!
